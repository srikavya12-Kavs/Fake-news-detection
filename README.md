Fake News Detection Using ML Classification and Boosting Algorithms

Overview
This project aims to create a machine learning model capable of detecting and classifying fake news articles. 
By leveraging various classification algorithms and boosting techniques, the system provides reliable predictions to help identify misinformation.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization.
Classification Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Trees.
Boosting Techniques: Implemented AdaBoost and XGBoost to improve model accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics: Used precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to assess model performance.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, AdaBoost
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
IDE: Jupyter Notebook
Dataset
This project uses a public dataset that contains news articles labeled as either real or fake. The dataset should be preloaded into the /data directory or linked from an external source.
Results
The project reports metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1-score to show the performance of each model.
Boosting algorithms (XGBoost and AdaBoost) significantly improved the accuracy and robustness of the fake news classification.
